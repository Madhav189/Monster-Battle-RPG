# | Principle       | How It's Used                                                   |

# |----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

# | \*\*Abstraction\*\*   | `Character` class abstracts common attributes and behavior     |

# | \*\*Encapsulation\*\* | Fields are private with getters/setters                        |

# | \*\*Inheritance\*\*   | `Player`, `Monster`, and `BossMonster` inherit from `Character` |

# | \*\*Polymorphism\*\*  | Each subclass overrides the `attack()` method                  |

# | \*\*Composition\*\*   | Player will be extended with inventory or weapon features      |
